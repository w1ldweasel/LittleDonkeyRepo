Will put notes in here asap


Removed some of the completity around upper and lower case l or L and E or e.  Now code forces selections to lower case regardless of input, also if another key is submitted program will tell you and just escape.

Added the append to the lotto numbers as i think it would be more efficient to just add to the end rather than generate it ALL prior to making it a string.

Added sorting of the numbers to Lotto / Euro Balls and Star Balls.
