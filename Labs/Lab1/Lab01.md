## Weather Data

The following is a Python coding task to analyse historic weather data.

1. Use 10+ years of weather data to calculate the monthly average for: 
..* minimum and maximum temperatures, 
..* precipitation,
..* hours of sunlight.

2. Present this data in chart form for an average year, label the chart and data elements.

3. Publish the chart in an electronic document, e.g. HTML.  

+Include a readme file with instructions of how to run your script on command line or IDE.
+If the task is incomplete, add explanatory notes on how it can be completed.

## Notes
This resource from the Met Office has historic data from a number of weather stations.
 
[Met Office Historic Data](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data)

-You can use this or another resource that provides access to data from an API service or file store.

-Include a readme file that has helpful instructions that tells a user what dependencies they may need to install and how to run your script.

-You have discretion in the number of charts used to meet the brief.

-Let the user select the city or location by entering it as a command line argument or setting a properties file parameter.  If they are limited to certain locations, advise what those as a list.

-If you are unable to write a complete solution, include #TODO comments on how to finish the code.
