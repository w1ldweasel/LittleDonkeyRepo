# Lab 1 

## Weather Data

**The following is a Python coding task to analyse historic weather data.**

1. Use 10+ years of weather data to calculate the monthly averages for: 
  * minimum and maximum temperatures, 
  * precipitation,
  * hours of sunlight.

2. Present this data in chart form for a whole year's worth of monthly values, label the chart and data elements.

3. Publish the chart in an electronic document, e.g. HTML or Jupyter notebook.  


## Notes
This resource from the Met Office has historic data from a number of weather stations. 
[Met Office Historic Data](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/historic-station-data)

- You can use this or another resource that provides access to data from an API service or file store.

- Include a readme file that has helpful instructions that tells a user what dependencies they need to install and how to run your script.

- You have discretion in the number of charts used to meet the brief.

- Let the user select the city or location by entering it as a command line argument or setting a properties file parameter or as a parameter in a UI or API request, you are free to choose any type of user input method.  
If they are limited to certain locations, advise what those are as a list.

- If you are unable to complete this lab on time, include #TODO comments on how you intend to finish the code.

Upload your solution to a public github repo and advise what that location is for the code to be reviewed.
