differences between code
-------------------------

lotto generates 6 random numbers and prints them.

euromillions gets a random number from a range, adds to end of list and prints them.

- not sure if running time would be impacted by the append command, as opposed to just printing and I can't see a benefit in appending, as all numbers are printed at one time within the function.
- lotto doesn't define a range, so number could be generated which is not appropriate for the game.

lotto code is simpler, so better for maintenance, however there is no ability to control the range of numbers, therefore think euromillions is superior.
(I think ideal code would be a combo - use lotto code but add a range)
