## create a NN
## split the password list 80:20, the 80 used for training, the 20 for testing
## create a dataset of random strings, the same length as the password length, also split 80:20
## train the NN with the 80% splits of used passwords and not knowingly used passwords
## test, if the 20% sample is less than 95% accurate, train again
## save the trained model
